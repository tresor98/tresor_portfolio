# [Project 1: Scraping reviews on Amazon](https://github.com/tresor98/amazon_scraping_reviews)
Scraping through reviews on amazon given a list of product ids
The first code (amazon_reviews.ipynb) scrape syncronously thus is a bit slower
The second code(faster_webscraping) scrapes asyncrously thus going faster

It is recommend to use a VPN while using the codes for a better results.

You might need to rerun the code for the data that returned empty list as data for some product ids may not be fetched at the first attempt.
